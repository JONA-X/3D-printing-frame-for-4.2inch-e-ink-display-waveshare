# 3D printed frame for a 4.2" e-ink display by Waveshare

This is a frame for a 4.2" e-Ink display by Waveshare. The display can be put easily in the indentation in the frame. Only the real part of the display (the pixels you can change) will be visible trough the front of the frame. 

There is a fixation structure (the two objects next to the frame) which can be used to fixate the display in the frame. 

The cover plate has a hole for a power supply cable which can go out of the frame. In order to screw down the cover plate, four M3 nuts need to be glued in the corresponding hexagonal holes. Four M3 screws are needed with a length between 8mm and 20mm.
